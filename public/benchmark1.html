    <h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
    <p>
        This document describes a game called "Chains Of Fury", a single-player level-based 2D action game in which the player controls a demon to defeat foes in progressively challenging battles that test your strategic thinking and maneuverability.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3> TECHNOLOGY </h3>
    <p>
        Chains Of Fury will be made primarily for MacOS and Windows using Wolfie2D, a game engine created by Joe Weaver and Professor Richard McKenna. Using this engine, this game will heavily utilize tiles, sprites, AI, physics, and collision boxes.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3> BACK STORY </h3>
    <p>
        Hell is a place where only one reigns supreme: the Demon King. No demon can go against his power, primarily because he possesses the Crown of Obedience. All creatures of Hell must follow his rule, or be vanquished from existence by the Crown. 
        This power is not everlasting, however. Every millennium, the crown decides upon a new owner. As the time is close at hand, the current demon king announces a tournament boasting Hell's cream of the crop to fight for the throne.
        Azazel, a vengeful demon residing in the depths of Hell, has been training with his meteor hammer for centuries, all for this moment. Ever since the Demon King sentenced his father to death, Azazel had been patiently waiting for his chance at revenge. And so he enters the tournament with only two goals in mind: to claim the Crown and kill the current Demon King.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>
        The tournament is single-elimination, so Azazel must not lose to any opponent that he's faced with. To defeat his opponent, Azazel must drain the opponent's health entirely before advancing on to the next stage. However, if Azazel's health is drained first, he is eliminated and the player must start from the beginning.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <ul>
        <h3>Scenes</h3>
        <li>
            The in-game battle scene will consist of the hellish, brutal arena containing Azazel and his opponent. Azazel will be able to run up, down, left, and right and perform actions such as swinging his meteor, throwing a projectile, and blocking. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Splash Screen - consists of the logo of the game, an Azazel animation, and the arena in the background. Clicking any button will bring the player to the main menu.
        </li>
        <li>
            Main menu - Displays buttons for play (to start playing from first level), select level (to start from any level), controls (to see what each control does, and to set the control), and help screen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Level Selection Screen - each level will be displayed with a number denoting which level a choice is referring to. Clicking on the levels without completing them will do nothing. All levels will be locked until the game is fully completed. All levels will be replayable once the game is finished.
        </li>
        <li>
            Control screen: displays the keys used in the game (refer to action controls in Gameplay section). Possibly will include graphics of the keys.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help screen: tells Azazel's story (refer to Backstory section). Provides cheat codes at the end used for testing.
        </li>

        <h3>Action Description</h3>
        <li>
            His basic swing will simply swing his meteor once, dealing damage to any opponent that stands directly in front of him.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the button for the basic swing is held, Azazel will perform a combo swing, where he swings his meteor multiple times in succession, dealing damage to any opponent that stands directly in front of him. Each singular hit will be weaker than the basic swing, but the swings will come out much faster than using the basic swing multiple times. During this combo swing, Azazel is stationary and can only move once the button for the combo swing is no longer held.
        </li>
        <li>
            His projectile consists of a fireball that can be thrown either up, down, left, or right. It can be charged to increase its power and distance. Getting hit during the charge will stop its charge. The mana for this projectile will have its own meter, which will charge slowly overtime as it's used.
        </li>
        <li>
            Azazel's guard allows him to greatly decrease the damage taken from physical attacks and projectiles. This guard has its own meter which will drain as more attacks connect with his guard. The meter will charge slowly over time as it's used. Pressing guard at the precise time will perform a parry, stunning the enemy for a short period of time allowing for Azazel to retaliate.
        </li>

        <h3>Item Shop</h3>
        <li>
            There will be a small item shop between levels allowing for you to spend coins to increase your stats. These coins will be collected by damaging/beating bosses. Items TBA.
        </li>

        <h3>Azazel's Opponents</h3>
        <ul>
            <h3>Enemy 1: Wolf</h3>
            <li>
                Sprite: Hellhound and moon_dog sprite
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 1: Moon_dog spawns three hellhounds, and sits back and lets the hellhound attack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hellhound attack pattern: Circles around the players, then charges one at a time towards the player, ending up on the opposite end of the circle. If the player blocks the charge, the hound gets stuck in melee range.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 2: When the three hounds are defeated: Moon_dog uses the hellhound attack pattern, but does more damage, is faster, and maybe some special attack.
                Maybe some charges will be extra long, so that the dog distances themselves from the player, and tries to summon hounds again. The player would need to interrupt the summon, otherwise phase 1 starts again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Phase 3: Same attack pattern, but before charging, darkens the screen to decrease visibility.
            </li>

            <h3>Enemy 2: Death Stalker</h3>
            <li>
                Sprite: death_stalker
            </li>
            <li>
                Pattern: Attacks with large, clunky and unblockable spells. Teleports after a stun timer after getting hit. Interrupting at various times of casting would give different amounts of stun times. After being lowered to 25%, starts using teleports as engage to get in melee range. Melee attack is an instantaneous sword attack. If not blocked, the enemy will try to instantly teleport away.
            </li>

            <h3>Enemy 3: Lord Reyalf</h3>
            <li>
                Sprite: mind_flayer
            </li>
            <li>
                Casts a variety of elemental magic spells (fire, ice, earth, etc). Also has the ability to summon hellhounds during battle. Shadow demons (sprite: shadow_demon) will stand idle in the front Reyalf. If the player enters their range, they will attack. Once Reyalf takes damage, he will teleport to the other side of the arena and resummon 5 shadow demons. 50% or less health and Reyalf to increase casting speeds by 25%. 25% or less health and Reyalf unleashes an unstoppable stun attack in addition to the normal spells he casts (user will be warned beforehand)
            </li>

            <h3>Enemy 4: Grim Reaper</h3>
            <li>
                Sprite: reaper
            </li>
            <li>
                An extremely fast physical attacker that swings its scythe at the player. Has an instadeath spell that covers a wide radius: player must not be in that radius at the time or they will die. At 50% health, he will start teleporting to random corners of the arena and throwing long arc slashes, in addition to his normal attacks. These slashes will bounce around the arena and last for a short duration of time. At 25% health, he gains a 50% movement speed buff, attacks do 25% more damage. His instadeath spell delay will also be shortened, causing the player to have to move out of the area faster.
            </li>

            <h3>Enemy 5: King's Sanction</h3>
            <li>
                Sprite: flying_sword
            </li>
            <li>
                Moves: Throws slash projectiles at Azazel's location, can teleport to where Azazel is and slash him from behind, can parry Azazel's attacks and projectiles, slashes from regular blocking go through and must be parried to avoid taking heavy damage.
            </li>

            <h3>Enemy 6: The Demon King</h3>
            <li>
                Sprite: wraith
            </li>
            <li>
                Moves TBA, but this boss will incorporate everything that the player has encountered except at a much greater difficulty (attacks do more health, are more erratic, and smarter).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
